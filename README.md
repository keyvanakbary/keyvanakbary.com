Welcome to my personal blog, I really appreciate your interest! I usually write here about **software fundamentals**, **good practices** and **object oriented programming**. Feel free to add, fix or even remove information through fancy pull requests.

If you want to be up-to-date with the latests articles and changes you only need to star this repo and follow the feed.

Thank you! You're awesome!
